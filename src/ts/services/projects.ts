    I collaborated on a webshop project with a shopping cart that used localStorage. 
    We developed the webshop using TypeScript, SCSS, and HTML. 
    It was a challenging and rewarding experience to create a 
    functional webapplication.
    Working with my team members, we ensured the webshop was visually appealing 
    and easy to navigate. Overall, it was a great opportunity to apply our skills 
    in a real-world project.

    In the start of my JavaScript course, 
    I created a to-do list using JavaScript and LocalStorage. 
    It helped me apply my newly acquired programming knowledge 
    and learn about web storage. I could add, edit, 
    and delete tasks and view them anytime since the data 
    was locally stored in the browser. 
    The project was simple yet provided a strong foundation for future course projects.

    In my JavaScript course, 
    I retrieved data from the OMDB RESTful API using Fetch and/or Axios. 
    The project taught me how to handle API calls and response data
     and display it in a meaningful way. It was challenging to work with 
     the API, but I learned a lot and successfully displayed data in my project. 
     This exercise provided a better understanding of using REST APIs in JavaScript 
     applications.
