    `As a student in school, 
    I have taken advantage of the opportunities to work on various web application projects. 
    These projects provided hands-on experience in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
    and in the near future, frameworks like React. 
    I applied the knowledge I gained in class to create functional 
    and hopefully visually appealing web pages. 
    These projects not only helped me improve my web development skills, 
    but also gave me the chance to collaborate with classmates and develop my teamwork 
    and problem-solving abilities.
